# hello-world
My first repository

Hello I'm bealeness and I've been learning to code for about a month now.  
The coolest thing I've learned so far has to be Python.  
My favourite project is Django Blog with Corey Schaefer.  My blog site
is at www.bobnewmann.com.  This is my first time using Git Hub and I
look forward to becoming much better at finding my way around.
This week I'm learning SQL.

Thank you for letting me introduce myself,
Hopefully see you around.

bealeness.
